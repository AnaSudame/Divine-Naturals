# Divine-Naturals 
I created a landing page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a mock company that sells superfoods & herbal products.
This time I pushed my project using the CLI; it was quite a learning experience for me. I faced some challenges while doing so, but finally figured it out. 
So proud of myself for this little achievement :)
